# Spotify Database Design
Design a database for the Spotify website. 
- Identifying the necessary tables and created them on the E-R diagram. 
- Tables are as follows: tbluser, tblplaylist, tblfolloweduser, tblpremiummembership, tblsong, tblsessionhistory, tblsearchhistory, tbldevices, tblfavouritesong, tblcomment. 
- The columns required for these tables have been added with appropriate data types. 
The primary keys of the tables were determined.
The foreign keys were added.
- Designed a form application that allows data entry into the spotify database. 
- Used C# form for this and included the necessary tools and packages in project to connect Postgresql database to form application.
- Created 10 forms for 10 tables in the database also created a query form where display queries. 
- With the form application, it can both add data to database and query the data.
